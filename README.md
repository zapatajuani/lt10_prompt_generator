# LT-10 GPS Tag (GlobalSat) Prompt Generator

In this web page we have a simple prompt generator that converts all the fields that can be changed in the LT-10 to a hex string so you can make the changes without using the application.

It's easy to use, the user just has to change the parameters they want to update and if the values are correct it will generate a hex string at the bottom of the page.

It can be use [here](https://zapatajuani.github.io/lt10_prompt_generator/).
